<h2>Description</h2>
Azure Active Directory (AD) is often a critical component in many cloud-based Azure solutions. With Azure AD you have a centralized identity and access management platform, which helps for much more than simply storing user details and credentials. In this project, we'll walk through bulk operations that can be performed within the Azure Portal, to help streamline the management of user accounts and security groups.
<br />
<br />
Consider the following scenario:
<br />
You work as a systems administrator for an organization that has a lot of seasonal projects. As a result, it's very common for you to have to create and delete a large volume of users every few months throughout the year, as well as manage relevant security groups.
<br />
<br />
To get started, you would like to practice the following operations within your empty demo Azure AD tenant:
<br />
<br />
- Creating and deleting users in bulk
<br />
- Managing group membership in bulk
<br />
